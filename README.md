Numerical Methods Python Modules

Hello Folks,

In this library, you can find Python modules for numerical methods such as newtonRaphson, MonteCarlo, Runge-Kutta etc. These numerical methods
are widely using in computational engineering and sciences.

Feel free to use and share these codes and let me know if I have any mistake.
